FRC Manager provides live competition data from the Blue Alliance based around your team for the FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC®). Provides competition schedule as well as a team specific schedule.

This is just the initial release of the app and I plan on adding more features as competition season progresses. Feel free to email me with features you would like added or problems with that app you are experiencing. I am an alumni of FRC® Team 2059 The Hitchhikers and mentor for 2059, 2642, and 2682.
